can `sellIn` be negative? no?
if `Sulfuras` never has to be sold, does it make sense to track `sellIn`?
is `ThirtyDays/stdout.gr` correct for stuff other than `Conjured`
should there be guards like setting quality of the item to >50 like 55 since it is going to keep that value?
why does Aged increase by 2 in negative?
